## 🌏 Just the beginning...🌏

I have recently completed a **Full-Stack Nano Degree** and am set to complete a **Cyber Security Masters** with Code First Girls – a national initiative aimed at promoting gender equality and encouraging more women into tech.

I’m now looking to take my first step into the tech world, pursuing a **career switch from communications**, following a decade-long interest in technology. As a **full-time working parent** with a one-year-old, I have dedicated my free time to learning, balancing two-hour classes four nights a week along with an additional 20 hours per week for assignments and revision.

I would love to join a company that **shares my values** of continuous learning and development, where I can continue to grow and contribute meaningfully. 💡

**I'm looking for a role in tech where I can thrive, learn, and make an impact!** 🚀
